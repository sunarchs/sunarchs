- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunarchs
- 👀 I’m interested in re-discovering the somewhat elemenatry level of coding I did back in college (Basic, Fortran, Cobol...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript (and also learned Python a few years ago).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building projects with JavaScript and Python; learning more of the hands on of where to build and store code; how to 'deploy' it on a PC/Mac.
- 📫 How to reach me sunil.chhabra@gmail.com
